    title: "Raft Leader Election Protocol Implementation",
    details: [
      "Developed the leader election phase of the Raft consensus protocol for a fault-tolerant key/value storage system.",
      "Implemented randomized election timeouts and RequestVote RPCs to elect a leader in a distributed system.",
      "Designed heartbeat mechanisms using AppendEntries RPCs to ensure leadership stability and reset election timeouts.",
      "Achieved fault tolerance with automatic recovery and re-election of a leader after network partitions or server crashes. Validated the implementation against provided test cases, passing scenarios for initial elections and re-elections post-failures."
